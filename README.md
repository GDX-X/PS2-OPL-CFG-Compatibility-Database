# PS2-OPL-CFG-Compatibility-Database


I created this repository to list all game compatibility for OPL

If you want to participate to enlarge the database please open a issue


An example of what you need to send to be added to the database:

Inside CFG                       
`Title=Game Name`                     
`$Compatibility=2`               
`Modes=2`      (Optional)                        
`$ConfigSource=1`                      

--------------------------------------------------------------

This script was created to be used mainly with PFS Batchkit Manager

These two gameids do not really exist but are used with PFS Batchkkit Manager to have different names 
because these ids share the same gameid as other games

`SLUD_206.43.cfg` = `SLUS_206.43.cfg`
`SLUG_202.73.cfg` = `SLUS_202.73.cfg`
