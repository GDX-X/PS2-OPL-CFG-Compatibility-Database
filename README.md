# PS2-OPL-CFG-Compatibility-Database


I created this repository to list all game compatibilities modes that we need for OPL

This script was created to be used mainly with [__PFS BatchKit Manager__](https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager)

These two gameids do not really exist but are used with PFS BatchKit Manager to have different names 
because these ids share the same gameid as other games

`SLUD_206.43.cfg` = `SLUS_206.43.cfg` Namco Transmission v1.03 <br/>
`SLUG_202.73.cfg` = `SLUS_202.73.cfg` Namco Museum 50th Anniversary <br/>
See more infos SOON

You can find the list of games available in the database\
[__HDD__](https://github.com/GDX-X/PS2-OPL-CFG-Compatibility-Database/blob/main/Games_List_HDD.txt)

# Contribute to the project 

If you want to enlarge the database please open a issue 
with the information below

NOTE: HDD = Internal\
NOTE: USB = External

An example of what you need to send to be added to the database:\
`NOTE: Modes=2+1+3 are optional, they are just used to identify the activated modes`

`ISSUE TITLE: [HDD] Game Name`
```
Title=Game Name
$Compatibility=2
Modes=2
$ConfigSource=1
```
